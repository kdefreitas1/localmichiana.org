## General Information

This website was made in 1 semester for a capstone class. The idea was to create a website that promotes the local community. Originally, the website was meant to display all of the events, things to do, and places to go in Michiana. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to complete every item in just one semester, but it will be worked on in the future. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
